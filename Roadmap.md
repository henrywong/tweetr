**Explanation of Critical, Major & Minor**

Importance of tasks will be differentiated by _Critical_, _Major_ and _Minor_ - meaning:

  * **Critical:** _This Task will definitely be implemented for the next Release._
  * **Major:** _This Task has to be in the next Release if no major problems make it impossible to release it._
  * **Minor:** _This would be nice to have, but if time is short, it will be pushed back for another release._
